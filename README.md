# CUPED-vs-Linreg
This project contained comparison of CUPED and Linreg in terms of variance reduction and bias.
Main findings are that linear rergression is unbiased no matter how much regressors we include in the model and nometer how big is the effect. While CUPED can be severly biased if we include too many ( even relevant) regressors in the model or if effect is large.
