# CUPED-vs-Linreg
This project contained comparison of CUPED and Linreg in terms of variance reduction and bias.
Main findings are that linear rergression is unbiased no matter how much regressors we include in the model. While CUPED can be severly biased if we include too many ( even relevant) regressors in the model.
